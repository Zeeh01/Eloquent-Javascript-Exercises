# Eloquent-Javascript-Exercices
Hi! My name is Jos√© Arthur. I'm a 30 years old Brazilian guy eager to learn.
I've tried to learn to code two times before, but failed. Now I'm determined to keep on.
I can study 40min a day during my workweek and 4 hours at my day off. 
The way I decided to learn was buying a book (Eloquent JavaScript) and see where and how it goes.
Here in this repository I'll keep track of my progress, uploading my book's exercices and projects.
Feel free to give me insights and teach me new methods. I'm allways open minded to new points of view.
