/*
I didn't wanted to look at the solution, but I checked on the internet a way to make a string repeat itself by a certain value.
This was the way I managed to do it:
*/

let height = prompt("Type the height");
let width = prompt("Type the width");
let str1 = " #"
let str2 = "# "
for (let n = 1; n <= height; n += 1) {
  if (n % 2 == 0)
    console.log(str1.repeat(width));
  else
    console.log(str2.repeat(width));
}
